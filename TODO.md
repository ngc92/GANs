# TODO
* CGAN
  - how do we feed in the conditioning vector?
  - generic framework?
* network architecture in general
* Look through height/width in code. TF seems to have ordered them as (height, width)
* Compare Network Architecture with DCGAN paper
* Read DCGAN paper
* Activation Noise in Discriminator
